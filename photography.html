    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>
      I started my experience with photography in the freshman year when I got a
      pretty challenging assignment of curating, composing and editing a fashion
      magazine that features my own designs. It pushed me to make fashion
      photography production, with that experience I got to know that how visual
      content creation can achieve aside from the subject itself. Beginning with
      fashion photography, I am now open up my horizon in a wider context of
      photography.
