    <h1>Major</h1>
    <h2>Fashion Design at Parsons</h2>
    <p>
      As a designer with a comprehensive background, I pursue this vision by a
      combination of diverse media including appeal design and visual designs
      including photography, graphics and virtual experience such as 3d assets
      and websites. I create clothes that are rooted in the body’s tactility and
      movement. I believe clothes as our chosen and changeable skin while
      interacting with the world, which should be the marriage of human body and
      the broader rhythm of the nature. By incorporating visual communication
      depicting the design and constructing process, I work on reaching the
      whole strength of impact this most intimate media to our body, fashion,
      with a visualization of its intelligence value.
