    <h1>Hi, I am Kai.</h1>
    <p>
      She, her pronouns. I am a junior majoring in fashion design and minoring
      in photography. I want to learn more about interactive design because I
      found this experience can be really helpful when creating visual materials
      for my own designs. I combined 2d and 3d method to express my inspiration
      and design process, and now I want to bring in interactive elements to
      further support it. I have basic experience with building websites on
      Cargo, and I expect to gain more advanced skills to have more design
      freedom. The fun fact will be I found out that Kai is a name that already
      exists in many languages (of course, including English), and it is my
      original Chinese name. So no need for translation and no pronunciation
      difficulties hh.
