    <h1>Favorite Food</h1>
    <p>
      I am a person who enjoys discovering new and unique tastes and flavours.
      When go on a trip I always take food as one of the most memorable and
      accessible way to get know a city and a culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in daily life my ‘favourite’ food can be really normal and even
      ‘plain’. I like fries, although for health I seldom have it. I also enjoy
      pastries and desserts, almost all kind of them as long as they are not
      cloyingly sweet.
