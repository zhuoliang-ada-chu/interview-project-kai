    <h1>Favorite Movie</h1>
    <h3><i>Monster</i>, 2024, by Hirokazu Kore-eda</h3>
    <p>
      That would be Monster (2024, by Hirokazu Kore-eda). It tells a story of
      how two young boys interact with the world when encountering,
      experiencing, with confusion, hesitation but also courage. Only for the
      story to unfold through shifting perspectives that reveal deeper truths
      about perception, empathy, and what it means to be a “monster.” The film
      blends mystery and emotional insight in a thoughtful exploration of
      family, childhood, and human complexity. It is also the starting point
      that encourage me to discover more Japanese director’s works. In all, I
      think it is a perfect example of what gap between reality and fantasy,
      surrealism, ambiguity and metaphor can achieve in a movie, which is a
      media that combines visuals and audio.
