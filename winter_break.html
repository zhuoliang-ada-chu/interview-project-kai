    <h1>A 9-day Trip to Malaysia With My Parents</h1>
    <p>
      What Malaysia inspire me most is how different cultures diffuse into each
      other. Many of Malaysians learn languages other than English and their own
      language. They also enjoy food from other cultures. I especially like
      Penang, where historical architectures are living alive just at the next
      corner of the city. And Malaysia is undeniably a place rich in delicious
      food!

      A two days immersive skiing experience in East Sichuan: I went on a two
      days full-day ski learning on a mountain in East Sichuan, where is above
      altitude 3500. It was super exhausted but extend my body’s ability was
      satisfying too! The frosty forest on the mountain was absolutely
      breathtaking.
