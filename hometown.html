    <h1>Hometown</h1>
    <p>
      There is kind of an ambiguity when talking about my hometown. My parents
      all came from a poor small village in a South-West China Provece—Sichuan.
      But then in their 20s they all moved to Guangzhou so I was born and raised
      there. Guangzhou is one of China’s most developed metropolises, shaped by
      a long history of openness and cultural inclusivity. It has long welcomed
      people, goods, and ideas from around the world, cultivating a tolerant and
      pragmatic urban spirit that continues today. At the same time, Guangzhou
      is known for a relaxed and caring life philosophy—valuing comfort, good
      food, and emotional ease as much as ambition or speed. It is also
      considered as one of the most ‘deliscious’ city in China. You can always
      see Cantonese food in Chinatown all over the world. In all, welcome if you
      have a chance to visit!
